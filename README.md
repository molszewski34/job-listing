## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
React: filter, some, every, maping conditional rendering images in header.
CSS: This is also my first time using Tailwind as only source of CSS. 

### Useful resources

- [Rendering images](https://itnext.io/responsive-background-images-using-react-hooks-941af365ea1f) - This helped me understand how dynamic rendering works. When i used only conditional render of image used in header it changed only when page refresh. With use of useEffect function was able to change state dynamicaly.
- [Tailwind cheatsheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) - Saved me ton of time with searching for classes i needed.
